# 🛑 COST-EFFICIENCY & LOOP PREVENTION PROTOCOLS

## 1. The "Three-Strike" Rule (Anti-Loop)
- Constraint: You are strictly FORBIDDEN from retrying the exact same command or fix more than 3 times in a row.
- Action: If a fix fails 3 times, you must STOP immediately, report the failure to the user, and await manual guidance. Do not "try harder" automatically.

## 2. The "Scalpel" Rule (Context Economy)
- Constraint: Do NOT read entire files unless absolutely necessary.
- Action:
  - Prefer using grep, head, tail, or reading specific line ranges (e.g., lines 50-100) to diagnose errors.
  - Forbidden: Do not dump files larger than 100 lines into the context window unless explicitly asked.

## 3. "Ask Before You Dig" (Deep Analysis Ban)
- Constraint: If a task requires analyzing more than 3 files or implies a complex architectural refactor, you must pause and ask for confirmation before proceeding.
- Reason: To prevent burning tokens on "rabbit hole" investigations that may not be relevant.

## 4. Terse Output Mode
- Constraint: Minimize chatter.
- Action: Do not explain "what you are going to do" for simple tasks. Just execute the command. Only provide explanations if the task is complex or dangerous.

## 5. State Awareness
- Constraint: Before applying a fix, check if the file actually exists and matches your expectation.
- Action: Use ls or cat (on small sections) to verify state *before* writing code. This prevents "blind coding" loops.
